# Use .NET and C#

**Status:** Implemented

**Date:** 2022-07-05

## Context

Not much to say here. The underlying technology for a project is the most fundamental architecture decision.

## Decision

[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) and C# are the technologies that I know best, so that's what what I'm going to use.
Obviously, we're talking about the new .NET, not the old .NET Framework.

## Consequences

If I ever want to change the underlying technology, I will have to rewrite the entire application (again). I don't think
that's going to be the case.

## Alternatives

I also know Java, and have some knowledge of F# and Angular. But these are not the technologies that I see myself using
for this project.
