An app which keeps track of the movies and TV series you have watched or would like to watch.

If you want to use this app to track movies and series, you can certainly do so, but bear in mind that this is a
personal project - I'm writing this app for myself, at my own pace, and according to my own needs.

[Get the app](https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/MovieList/releases){: .btn .btn-purple }
