# About Cineaste

A long time ago I started keeping a list of movies and TV series I've watched and would like to watch. Keeping track of all these movies and series in a Word document because cumbersome since now there are more than a thousand items \(I watch a lot of movies\). Thus I've decided to create an app so that the list can be more structured and so that I can analyze the data somehow. Also, this is a fun side project.

## Project Status

I've been working on this app since February 2019 and it's not nearly done. I've released versions 0.1 through 0.3, because now the app is at least usable, although it still lacks lots of features. Versions 0.x should be considered pre-release and as such probably shouldn't be used in general since there will be breaking changes.

I'm actively working on the app, although sometimes I take breaks to work on other projects, so expect more versions soon.
