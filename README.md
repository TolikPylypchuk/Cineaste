A web app which keeps track of the movies and TV series you have watched or would like to watch.

A long time ago I started keeping a list of movies and TV series I've watched and would like to watch. Keeping track
of all these movies and series in a Word document has become cumbersome since now there are more than a thousand entries
(I watch a lot of movies). Thus I've decided to create an app so that the list can be more structured and so that I can
analyze the data somehow. Also, this is a fun side project.

## Project Status

Currently the app is in the middle of major restructuring, so there is nothing usable here yet.
