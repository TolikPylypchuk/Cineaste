# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADR) are short semi-immutable documents which describe decisions which affect the
architecture of the application. [ADR-0000](0000-use-adr.md) is a meta-ADR which describes what ADRs are and how they
are structured.

Cineaste is a very simple project and as such, it doesn't really need ADRs - I simply want to practice.
